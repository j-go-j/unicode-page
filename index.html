<h1>Fun With Unicode</h1>

<p>Decimal codes for Unicode characters contain only numbers.  Hexadecimal codes contain numbers and letters in the A-F range.

<p>The popularity of emojis and emoticons has impacted the Unicode world.  The first emoji appeared in the Unicode Standard in 2009.  Although emoji were available in 1999 on Japanese mobile phones, it wasn't until 2009 that characters defined as "emoji" were added to Unicode 5.2. Between 1999 and 2006, the development of emoji and the way in which devices supported them (with encoding extensions) took different paths at different mobile phone carriers.  
<p>In 2006, Google began to work on converting Japanese emoji to Unicode for private use.  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/" target="_blank">Here </a>is a fascinating paper on Unicode Emoji, written by Mark Davis (Google) and Peter Edberg (Apple) date 5-18-17.</p>
